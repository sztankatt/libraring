		<h3>Our team</h3>
		<p>One of the most tiring duties of a university student is gathering his/her course related books. Every member of our team study as a university student and all of us know that finding and buying a rear book during a semester is one of the most complicated and expensive hardships that a student often encounters during his/her studies.</p>

		<p>Therefore we created a platform which opens a new online market with infinite possibilities to exchange any books you may need during your academic years.</p>
